This project turns C.H.I.P. into a terrible weather station by merging a hacked up [SparkFun Weather Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13956) and DS18B20 into a uncompensated pressure, temperature, and humidity probe.

# Tech Stack

Still in flux, but eventually this project should include the following tech:

- I2C usage on linux
- MQTT for emitting messages
- boost::date\_time
- Hacking the board

# PCB mods
